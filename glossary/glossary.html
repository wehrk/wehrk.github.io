  GENDYN — 'GEN'eration 'DYN'amique. Software implementation of dynamic stochastic synthesis by Iannis Xenakis and Marie-Helene Serra described in Formalized Music book by X. «Algorithm is an original example of nonstandard synthesis. It uses the mathematical concept of random walks to produce both duration structure and timbral fluctuations in computer-generated sound. This means that the probabilistic movement of random walks is used for wave-shaping sound synthesis as well as for controlling aspects of musical form» (P. Hoffmann, 2000). With different versions of this program X created compositions such as GENDY3 and S709.
